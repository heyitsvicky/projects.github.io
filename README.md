This is my first attempt at a personal portfolio website using purely html and css.
This has a bunch of random stuff right now, but as my computer science portfolio grows, so will this website!
This webstie has been a way to teach myself basic front-end development skills (just for fun) and through this I have learned html & css. 
I'm excited to continue growing this website as I grow as a developer as well :)
